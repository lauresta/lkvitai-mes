## Conventions

- Every section must cite **evidence**: file path + route or controller.
- Do NOT add business logic that cannot be traced to the repo.
- Unknown / unimplemented items → `universe/gaps-and-unknowns.md`.
- Architecture is frozen at **v2.0 FINAL BASELINE** (`docs/04-system-architecture.md`). Do not redesign.
