## Handoff Command for Implementation

```bash
# Verify all sprints complete
for sprint in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do
  echo "Sprint $sprint: $(grep -c '^## Task PRD-' docs/prod-ready/prod-ready-tasks-PHASE15-S${sprint}.md) tasks"
done

# Expected output:
# Sprint 1: 10 tasks
# Sprint 2: 10 tasks
# Sprint 3: 20 tasks
# Sprint 4: 20 tasks
# Sprint 5: 20 tasks
# Sprint 6: 20 tasks
# Sprint 7: 20 tasks
# Sprint 8: 20 tasks
# Sprint 9: 20 tasks

# Verify coverage matrix exists
cat docs/prod-ready/PHASE15-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md

# Verify final status
cat docs/prod-ready/PHASE15-FINAL-STATUS.md

# Start implementation from Sprint 1
echo "Ready for implementation: Start with PRD-1501 (Sprint 1)"
```

## Next Steps for Implementation Team

### 1. Sprint Execution Order
Execute sprints sequentially: Sprint 1 → Sprint 2 → Sprint 3 → Sprint 4 → Sprint 5 → Sprint 6 → Sprint 7 → Sprint 8 → Sprint 9

### 2. Task Execution
- Use task files directly: `docs/prod-ready/prod-ready-tasks-PHASE15-S{1-9}.md`
- Each task includes: Context, Scope, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Validation, Definition of Done
- Follow Definition of Done checklists (15-20 items per task)

### 3. Progress Tracking
- Update task status in sprint files as tasks complete
- Mark tasks as: `[ ]` (not started), `[-]` (in progress), `[x]` (completed)
- Track blockers and issues in `docs/prod-ready/codex-suspicions.md`

### 4. Quality Gates
- Run validation commands for each task (curl, SQL, dotnet test)
- Verify acceptance criteria (Gherkin scenarios)
- Complete all Definition of Done items before marking task complete

### 5. Documentation
- Update `docs/prod-ready/codex-run-summary.md` after each execution run
- Document any deviations from spec in `docs/prod-ready/codex-suspicions.md`
- Keep API documentation up to date (Swagger)

3. Order pricing engine (discounts, promotions, tiered pricing)
4. Multi-parcel shipments (1 order = multiple boxes)
5. International shipping (customs forms)
6. Real-time 3D updates via SignalR
7. Operator location tracking (RTLS integration)
8. Heatmap (pick frequency, travel time)
9. Path optimization (suggest shortest route)
10. Auto-scaling (Kubernetes HPA)
11. Global load balancing (multi-region)
12. FIFO/LIFO costing (weighted average only for Phase 1.5)
13. Cost layers (per-receipt costing)
14. Automated duty calculation
15. Write-through caching (cache-aside only)
16. Distributed cache coordination (single Redis instance)
17. Cache warming strategies
18. Database sharding (single-instance optimization only)
19. Read replicas
20. External connection poolers (PgBouncer)
